# DogCoinGame audit

## Introduction

This report provides an overview of the security of the [DogCoinGame](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ExtropyIO/ExpertSolidityBootcamp/main/exercises/audit/DogCoinGame.sol) smart contract. 

The audit identified potential security issues. The identified issues should be addressed to further improve the security of the contract.

## Findings

The following is a list of the potential security issues that were identified during the audit:

1) The DogCoinGame smart contract does not have a proper access control mechanism in place. This could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the contract and steal funds.
  - The `addPlayer` function does not require the caller to be an approved address. This means that any address can add themselves to the players list, even if they have not paid the $1 entry fee.
  - The `payout` function does not require the caller to be the owner of the contract. This means that any address can call the `payout` function and steal the funds in the contract.

2) The DogCoinGame smart contract does not have proper input validation in place. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious code into the contract and execute arbitrary commands.
  - The `addWinner` function does not validate the address of the winner. This means that an attacker could call the addWinner function with a malicious address, which could then be used to steal funds from the contract.

3) The DogCoinGame smart contract does not emit any events when players are added or winners are paid out.  
  - This means that it would be difficult to track down the smart contract calls.
  - This also means that it would be difficult to track down the source of any security breaches.

## Recommendations

The following are the recommendations for addressing the potential security issues that were identified during the audit:

1) Implement a proper access control mechanism to prevent unauthorized access to the contract.
2) Implement proper input validation to prevent malicious code from being injected into the contract.
3) Implement events to track down the smart contract calls.

## Conclusion

The identified issues should be addressed to further improve the security of the contract.
