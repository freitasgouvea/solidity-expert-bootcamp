2. What would happen if the implementation of a precompiled contract varied  between Ethereum clients ?

A: The different clients would not come to consensus and you get end up with forks of netowrk.

3. Using Remix write a simple contract that uses a memory variable, then using the debugger step through the function and inspect the memory.
